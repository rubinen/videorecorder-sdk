          PSplash is a tiny userspace graphical boot splash screen for mainly
          embedded Linux devices supporting a 16bpp or 32bpp framebuffer. It
          has few dependencies (just libc), supports basic images and text and
          handles rotation. Its visual look is configurable by basic source
          changes.

          Also included is a ‘client’ command utility for sending information
          to psplash such as boot progress information.
