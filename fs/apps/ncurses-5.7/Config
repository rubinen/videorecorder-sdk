          The Ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of curses
          in System V Release 4.0, and more. It uses Terminfo format, supports pads
          and color and multiple highlights and forms characters and function-key
          mapping, and has all the other SYSV-curses enhancements over BSD Curses.
