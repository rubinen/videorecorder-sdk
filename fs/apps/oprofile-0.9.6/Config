	    OProfile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems, 
            capable of profiling all running code at low overhead. 
            OProfile is released under the GNU GPL.

            It consists of a kernel driver and a daemon for collecting 
            sample data, and several post-profiling tools for turning 
            data into information.

            OProfile leverages the hardware performance counters of the CPU 
            to enable profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics, 
            which can also be used for basic time-spent profiling. All code 
            is profiled: hardware and software interrupt handlers, kernel 
            modules, the kernel, shared libraries, and applications.

            Enabling this application will include the standard C++ library 
            into the file system adding around 3.6MB to your target.

            It will also include the popt library, bash shell, and adds 
            awk, expr, mktemp and tr commands functionality to busybox.

            This package will add around 24MB to your target.

            If unsure, say N.
