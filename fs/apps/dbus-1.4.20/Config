	    D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk 
	    to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus 
	    helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable 
	    to code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch 
	    applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.
	    
	    D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware 
	    device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session 
	    daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the 
	    message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing 
	    framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly 
	    (without going through the message bus daemon).
