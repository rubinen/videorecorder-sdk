	eAccelerator is a free open-source PHP accelerator & optimizer. 
	It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in 
	their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost 
	completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up 
	their execution. eAccelerator typically reduces server load and 
	increases the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.
