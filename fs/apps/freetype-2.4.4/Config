	  FreeType 2 is a software font engine that is designed to be small,
	  efficient, highly customizable, and portable while capable of 
	  producing high-quality output (glyph images). It can be used in 
	  graphics libraries, display servers, font conversion tools, text 
	  image generation tools, and many other products as well.
	  
	  Note that FreeType 2 is a font service and doesn't provide APIs 
	  to perform higher-level features like text layout or graphics 
	  processing (e.g., colored text rendering, hollowing, etc.). However,
	  it greatly simplifies these tasks by providing a simple, easy to 
	  use, and uniform interface to access the content of font files.
