	Theora is an open video codec being developed by the Xiph.org 
	Foundation as part of their Ogg project (It is a project that 
	aims to integrate On2's VP3 video codec, Ogg Vorbis audio codec
	and Ogg multimedia container formats into a multimedia solution
	that can compete with MPEG-4 format).
	 
	Theora is derived directly from On2's VP3 codec; currently the 
	two are nearly identical, varying only in framing headers, but 
	Theora will diverge and improve from the main VP3 development 
	lineage as time progresses
