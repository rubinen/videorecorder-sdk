ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but insteadby the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the fileansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as partof any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more thanthe foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortiumbut is also freely distributable.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support hasbeen removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; theresulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standardGIF decoders.

We are required to state that"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property ofCompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property ofCompuServe Incorporated."]]>
