	This is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the code
	from GnuPG. It provides functions for all cryptograhic building
	blocks: symmetric ciphers (AES, DES, Blowfish, CAST5, Twofish,
	Arcfour), hash algorithms (MD4, MD5, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, TIGER-192),
	MACs (HMAC for all hash algorithms), public key algorithms (RSA,
	ElGamal, DSA), large integer functions, random numbers and a lot
	of supporting functions.
