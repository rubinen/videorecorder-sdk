	  Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices.
	  The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of 
	  PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling 
	  cubic Bzier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, 
	  and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed 
	  by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.)
