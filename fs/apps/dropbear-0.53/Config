         Dropbear SSH server and client

         Dropbear is a relatively small SSH 2 server and client. It runs 
         on a variety of POSIX-based platforms. Dropbear is open source 
         software, distributed under a MIT-style license. Dropbear is 
         particularly useful for "embedded"-type Linux (or other Unix) 
         systems, such as wireless routers.

         This package requires zlib.
