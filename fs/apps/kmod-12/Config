	kmod is a set of tools to handle common tasks with Linux kernel modules
	like insert, remove, list, check properties, resolve dependencies and 
	aliases. These tools are designed on top of libkmod, a library that is
	shipped with kmod. See libkmod/README for more details on this library and
	how to use it. The aim is to be compatible with tools, configurations and 
	indexes from module-init-tools project.
