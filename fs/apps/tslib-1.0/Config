          Tslib is an abstraction layer for touchscreen panel events, as well
          as a filter stack for the manipulation of those events. It was created
          by Russell King, of arm.linux.org.uk. Examples of implemented filters
          include jitter smoothing and the calibration transform.

          Tslib is generally used on embedded devices to provide a common user
          space interface to touchscreen functionality. It is supported by
          Kdrive (aka TinyX) and OPIE as well as being used on a number of
          commercial Linux devices including the Nokia 770.
