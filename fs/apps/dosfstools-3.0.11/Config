	    Utilities to create and check MS-DOS FAT filesystems.There are two
	    utilities (mkdosfs alias mkfs.dos, and dosfsck alias fsck.msdos)
	    to create and to check MS-DOS FAT filesystems on either hard disks
	    or floppies.
	    
	    Both mkdosfs and dosfsck include support for FAT32, VFAT long
	    filenames and now can also handle the Atari variation of the MS-DOS
	    filesystem format.
