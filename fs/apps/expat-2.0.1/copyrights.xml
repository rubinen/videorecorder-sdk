	<summary>Expat is a library, written in C, for parsing XML documents. It's the underlying XML parser for the open source Mozilla project, perl's XML::Parser, and other open-source XML parsers. As demonstrated in my benchmark article, it's very fast. It also sets a high standard for reliability, robustness and correctness.</summary>
