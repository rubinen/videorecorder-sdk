	  Iperf was developed as a modern alternative for measuring TCP
          and UDP bandwidth performance.

	  Iperf is a tool to measure maximum TCP bandwidth, allowing the
          tuning of various parameters and UDP characteristics. Iperf 
          reports bandwidth, delay jitter, datagram loss.
