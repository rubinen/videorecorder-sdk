	bool "Strip the target file system binaries (may render debug useless)"
	help
	  Enabling this option will strip the file system binaries of 
          all debug and other symbols. 
          If you are debugging applications, with gdb or oprofile, disable 
          this option. 

config FS_FSROOT
	string "Target file system destination directory -- leave blank to use $DEVDIR/fs/fs"
	default ""
	help
	  If you are using a source code management system, like ClearCase, or file
	  system that doesn't allow certian files to be created, such as device files,
	  then you can have the target file system $FSROOT located in a directory other
	  that within in the development directory $DEVDIR.  If this value is not blank,
	  the the actual directory used for $FSROOT is the directory specified here, plus
	  the basename of the $DEVDIR, plus "fs".  For example, if $FS_FSROOT is
	  /opt/target_file_systems and $DEVDIR is $HOME/work/dm385sdk, then the target
	  file system can be found in /opt/target_file_systems/dm385sdk/fs.  You also
	  should change busybox install directory CONFIG_PREFIX to "arm".
