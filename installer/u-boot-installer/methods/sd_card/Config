		The first partition on the SD card is a VFAT file system
		containing the uboot environement variables and the kernel.
		If other files need to be saved in the first partition, increase
		the size.  Note: Windows only mounts the first VFAT partition,
		so if you need to save files on the SD card that are readable by
		a Windows machine, use this setting to make room for those
		files.  If your root file system is initramfs, then the kernel
		image file will also contain the entire root file system, so
		the U-Boot VFAT partition will need to be larger.
